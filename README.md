# Log
- Had lots of issues throughout this build and learned many new things.
- Tailwind was a fun experience learning how to use it and impliment different syntax for css
- Tried to use Node.js middleware but with limited documentation, I ended up pausing the effort to finish the front end of the build

- Had many issues with the spotify API and found some issues related to the rewind and fast forward button calls

# Next Steps
- Further develop the front end of the site
- Fix the player css issues
- Implement the rest of the buttons
- Fix the middleware for sign in/out
- Finish the volume slider

# Important to Note!
- This is not offiliated with spotify nor meant to be used in a commercial manner.
- This is a work in progress and is not meant to be used as a final product.
- Project was designed for educational pruposes only.
